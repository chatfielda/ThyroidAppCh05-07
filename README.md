# ThyroidAppCh05-07
Chapter 5-7 version of the Thyroid App for JavaScript 3 class

CHAPTER 5

3.	Power consumption monitor: Over the following three chapters, we will create an app that monitors the power consumption of a manufacturing plant. You can model the app based on the Thyroid app. In this chapter, we will create the skeleton of the app, similar to the Thyroid app. Now, just create the pages and the links to navigate between them; you will implement the functionality of the pages in later chapters. The app will have
•	A password-based entry page.
•	A page to get basic information about the plant such as the plant ID and date of installation, along with an ability to change the password.
•	A menu page with four choices
i.	An option and corresponding page to allow you to change the basic information about the plant.
ii.	An option and corresponding page to enter data—power consumed.
iii.	An option and corresponding page to graph the data.
iv.	An option and corresponding page to make recommendations based on the values of power consumption.



CHAPTER 6

3.	Power consumption monitor: Please continue from the previous skeleton of an app that monitors power consumption of a manufacturing plant. You can model the app based on the Thyroid app. In this chapter, we will begin building out the pages in our skeleton app. 
o	Implement the password-based entry page.
o	Implement the page to get basic information about the plant such as the plant ID and date of installation, along with an ability to change the password.
o	We already have a menu page with four choices. We will only implement the first two choices for data entry and storage 
1.	Implement the page to allow you to change the basic information about the plant.
2.	Implement the page to enter data—power consumed



CHAPTER 7
Power consumption monitor: We want to complete the app that monitors the power consumption of a manufacturing plant. You can model the app based on the Thyroid app. 
o	We have already implemented the password-based entry page.
o	We have already implemented the page to get basic information about the plant such as the plant ID and date of installation, along with an ability to change the password.
o	We already have a menu page with four choices. We have already implemented the first two choices for data entry and storage 
1.	We have already implemented the page to allow you to change the basic information about the plant.
2.	We have already implemented the page to enter data—power consumed.
3.	We should now implement the page to graph the data.
4.	We should now implement the page to make recommendations based on the values of power consumption. The recommendations should be based on how the recent power consumption compares with the average of the power consumption in the past.
